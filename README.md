# just some Processing sketches

This is a simple website I've made to show off some of the sketches I've made in Processing. It can be found [here](https://katherinekolman.github.io/processing-visualizations/). Inspiration for the sketches mostly comes from [OpenProcessing](https://www.openprocessing.org).
